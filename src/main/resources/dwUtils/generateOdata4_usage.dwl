For an example, to search the 'PRODUCT' of which the ID is '201', instead of querying using '<baseURL>/PRODUCTS/201', it is '<baseURL>/PRODUCTS(201)'."
, "        NOTE_2: In some cases, the field type in the generated CSDL file may need to be fixed manually during the test due to the incompatibility between the runtime data with the data type defined in CSDL. For example, in MySQL, for fields of type 'decimal', some can be translated to 'Edm.Decimal', while some others must be translated to 'Edm.Double'.
